todos (1/2/2025):

- implement ship upgrading via refined minerals, adjust costs
- implement base upgrading via refined minerals, adjust costs

- make sure all stats are used in calculations

- add ship recall button, recalls ships mining -> idle

  - alien danger decreases at base rate when no ships mining

- make minerals mined be in cargo hold, not directly added, only convert to inventory when ships recalled
  - so that when ships get destroyed, the amount in their cargo gets forfeit too if ship lost and can't be repaired
